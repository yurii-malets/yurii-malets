## About me 👋
Hi, my name is Yura. Since 2023 I have been studying and practicing to become a QA Engineer. I am happy to have finally found an area where I can successfully develop myself. In this portfolio, I would like to share my knowledge of QA and showcase the practical skills that I have gained through self-study. I am determined to continue to grow in this field. I am a detail-oriented individual, an aspiring QA Engineer with a strong desire to build a career in software testing. I have a good understanding of QA/QC processes, requirements, methodology, testing types, etc. I consider myself a positive, proactive, responsible, and flexible person with good
communication and organization skills. I am excited to join a team where I can leverage my problem-solving skills and grow through practical experience in a real-world QA environment. I am eager to apply my knowledge and gain practical experience in software testing within a dynamic team environment to contribute to the quality assurance process and ensure high software standards.
